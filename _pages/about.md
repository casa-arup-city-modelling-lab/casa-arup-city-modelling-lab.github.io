CASA Arup City Modelling Lab - Research themes

Priority research themes:

1. Decarbonization
2. Climate Change adaptation
3. Energy system integrations
4. Inequalities in income, housing, transport, built environment, health and wellbeing
5. Electrification of vehicles (e.g., integration of ABMs with bottom-up energy models)
6. Micromobility (e.g. electrification, the last-mile, equity and health)

Additional discussions to support the above themes:
1. Road pricing (incl. links to vehicle emissions, fairness and equity, high subsidies for drivers).
2. How energy prices influence behaviour.
3. Disincentives for driving and improving public transport - how to do it fairly and equitably
4. Affordable housing and gentrification
5. (Healthy) high streets (e.g., charges for cars in city centre & its effects physical/online shops)
6. Future of flexible working and its effects on transport and housing
7. Data gaps to conduct research in areas of housing, retail, individual mobilities
